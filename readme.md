# CATSS LXX Data

This is a [Text-Fabric](https://github.com/Dans-labs/text-fabric) resource (python3) converted from the [publicly available](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rak//catss.html) Septuagint database. CATSS stands for "Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint/Scriptural Study." The data is supplied by the University of Pennsynvania's Center for Computer Analysis of Texts (CCAT).

Future versions of this dataset will include links to the Eep Talstra Centre for Bible and Computer's [BHSA Hebrew Database](https://github.com/ETCBC/bhsa) for use in statistical studies between the Hebrew Bible and Greek Septuagint.

*Note that the source datafiles are ignored and not uploaded to the repo since they are already available (see link above). 

Please read the CCAT [user agreement](http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxmorph/0-user-declaration.txt). It is the user's responsibility to follow the relevant copyright guidelines.
